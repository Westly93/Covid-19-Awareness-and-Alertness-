The project was developed using python libraries Kivymd, pandas, beautifulsoup, matplotlib

kivymd was used for designing of the mobile application
beautifulsoup was used for secreping different well recognized websites for more reliable information
matplotlib was then used to provide visual displays on the mobile app 
pandas was then used for reading and cleaning the data because some data was fetched in form of csv files

The main argument was that websites gives much irrevent information hence having a mobile application just ment for providing covid-19 updates would improving covid-19 information and alertness 
by giving relevant data at the right time
